# Podio API Overview

## Introduction
The Podio API provides comprehensive access to the Podio platform, enabling developers to build integrations, automate workflows, and manage organizational resources programmatically.

## Core Concepts

### Hierarchy
```
Organization
  └── Spaces (Workspaces)
      └── Applications (Apps)
          └── Items (Records/Rows)
```

### Key Components

1. **Organizations**: Top-level container for spaces and users
2. **Spaces**: Work areas where teams collaborate, containing apps and activities
3. **Applications**: Define structure and fields (like database tables)
4. **Items**: Individual records/entries within applications (like table rows)
5. **Flows**: Native workflow automation (triggers and actions)
6. **Hooks**: Webhooks for external integrations

## API Capabilities

### Workflow & Automation
- **Flows**: Built-in automation with triggers (item.create, item.update, item.delete) and actions (task.create, item.update, comment.create)
- **Hooks**: Webhooks for real-time event notifications to external systems
- **Integrations**: Pre-built connections to external services

### Data Management
- Full CRUD operations on items, apps, and organizational structures
- Advanced filtering and searching
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Field-level validation and custom types

### Collaboration Features
- Tasks and assignments
- Comments and conversations
- File attachments
- Status updates
- Calendar integration

## API Architecture

### Base URL
```
https://api.podio.com
```

### Authentication
OAuth 2.0 protocol with multiple authentication flows

### Response Format
JSON responses with consistent structure

### Rate Limits
Standard rate limiting applies (refer to API documentation for current limits)

## Common Use Cases

1. **Workflow Migration**: Copy automation flows between workspaces
2. **Data Synchronization**: Sync Podio data with external systems
3. **Custom Integrations**: Build specialized business process automation
4. **Reporting**: Extract and analyze data across organizations
5. **Bulk Operations**: Mass import/export of items and configurations

## Resources for Workflow Migration

Key APIs for copying Globiflow workflows:
- Organizations API: Identify source/target organizations
- Spaces API: List and manage workspaces
- Applications API: Get app structures and field definitions
- Flows API: Read and recreate automation workflows
- Hooks API: Migrate webhook integrations
- Items API: Understand data context and relationships

## Next Steps

1. Set up authentication (see `02-authentication.md`)
2. Understand organizational structure (see `03-organizations.md` and `04-spaces.md`)
3. Learn application and item management (see `05-applications.md` and `06-items.md`)
4. Explore workflow automation (see `07-flows.md` and `08-hooks.md`)
