Custom date validation with ISO 8601 support requires comprehensive edge case testing. Filter conversion layer between user-friendly format and API format provides clean separation of concerns.","files_touched":["lib/migration/items/filter-converter.ts","lib/migration/items/filter-validator.ts","lib/ai/schemas/migration.ts","lib/ai/tools.ts","lib/migration/items/service.ts","lib/migration/items/types.ts"]}

Reviewers caught 8 important issues including missing date validation, filter state handling bugs, and backwards compatibility gaps. Sequential worker pattern (backend→frontend→coherence) ensures clean layer separation. Filter persistence in job metadata enables reproducibility.","files_touched":["lib/migration/cleanup/types.ts","lib/migration/cleanup/service.ts","lib/migration/cleanup/executor.ts","app/components/migration/CleanupPanel.tsx","app/api/migration/cleanup/route.ts"]}

Auto-reconnect logic needs AbortController to prevent race conditions on mount. useMemo is better than useEffect for derived state like pagination. Following existing patterns (MigrationContext for storage, ItemMigrationPanel for job history UI) accelerates development significantly.","files_touched":["app/hooks/useCleanup.ts","app/components/migration/CleanupPanel.tsx","lib/migration/cleanup/types.ts","lib/migration/cleanup/service.ts"]}

Three patterns validated: (1) async useEffect needs AbortController + isMounted guard, (2) props in effect body must be in deps array - dont suppress eslint, (3) extend interfaces with Partial<Base> instead of duplicating fields.
